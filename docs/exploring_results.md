# Exploring Results

Once you have finished [running experiments](running_experiments.md), you can
explore the results of your experiments using the Zeno that will appear
(usually at the link [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)).

The basics of this exploration are covered by the
[Zeno Documentation](https://zenoml.com/docs/intro), so you can click over
to that to get more details!

## Next Steps

If you've explored your data and found anything interesting, we'd love
to have you share it with us! See the [contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
page for more details.
